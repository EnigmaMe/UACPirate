# Development Updates
**V1.0:** I've decided to start a GitHub for this project, because I think it may be intriguing to some people. I have currently built up the skeleton for this app using C# and the powah of Google. 


# UACPirate
UACPirate is a malicious windows UAC Prompt which will transmit credentials back to the attacker. This tool is meant to be used by Red Teams, Penetration testers, etc.

# Practical Uses
You've just gotten a shell on a box, and are looking to quickly gain credentials. How many times before have users seen the Windows UAC prompt and aimlessly typed in their credentials or had administrators do the same.
There are *some* unique advantages to this. Because this app has no malicious functions which get identified by Windows Defender.
